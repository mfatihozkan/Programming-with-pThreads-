		Methods of Achieving the Project Requirements 

PART A: Computing Fibonacci Numbers With Threads

- Struct type used to save data fibonacci sequence variables to compute fibonacci sequence by using threads.
- When the thread finishes execution, the parent thread outputs the fibonacci sequence generated by the child thread. 
  

PART B: Printing Words With sched_yield()

- Struct type used to save data of words of the phrase supplied on the command line.
- Sched_yield() functions used to print words and whether or not the initial character of vowel by using seperated two threads.

PART C: Efficiency of threads

- Struct type used to save data of generated random numbers such as average,minimum and maximum of the numbers.
- 50000 random numbers are generated between -200 and 200 and saved them into a file.
- Three seperated threads created to calculate min,max and avg numbers.
- Same program implemented another version which does not use any threads and print the results of min, max and avg numbers..
- gettimeofdday() functions are used to calculate execution times of threads and without threats parts.
